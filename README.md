Today I finished the website! It does look a little bit wacky tho, especially if you look at it from a design perspective, but I guess I just have to train my “eye for design” or whatever you might call it.

With this website I kind of reinforced what I’ve been learning so far but now I really want to take it to the next level. I’m going to search up a cool design and start working on it to keep learning new things as well as solidifying what I already know.

Just finished the experience section of the website and I’m currently working on the stats section. The stats section is going to display boxes with circles inside them that display how much percent of a certain stat that I have (or something similar). Now these circles will only be filled depending on the percentage, so for example if a stat is at 90% then it will display a circle with 10% of the border missing.

I hope that I’ll be able to accomplish that and add a cool animation to it as well (and hopefully add something more!!).

Got much more done today and learned a couple of things:

how to actually scale images/svgs with height: auto.
A deeper understanding of z-index (can’t be applied to statically positioned elements).
Tried to think of a third thing, but I overall gained more flexbox, positioning and general css/html experience.

Need to work on the animation of the svg tomorrow and make sure that I apply a flex wrap to the profile logo along with the name and title.

Started creating my personal website for myself. A lot of time went on finding images and svg’s that I can use to animate later on.

I’m also going to be using SASS when creating this website to really learn and understand how to use and implement it in my future projects.
